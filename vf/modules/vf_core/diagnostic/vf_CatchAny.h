/**
  Exception catcher.

  Executes the function and catches any exception.
  In addition to C++ exceptions, this will also catch
  any platform-specific exceptions. For example, SEH
  (Structured Exception Handling) on Windows, or POSIX
  signals if they are available.
    
  If returnFromException is false then a framework
  specific unhandled exception handler will be called.
  Otherwise, this function will return true if it
  catches something or else false.
    
  The return value approach is useful for detecting
  when outside code fails (for example, a VST plugin),
  and disabling its future use for example.
    
  @todo Remove dependence on the JUCEApplication object and remove juce_gui_basics.h from vf_core.cpp

  @param f The function to call.

  @param returnFromException `false` if exceptions should terminate the app.

  @return `true` if an exception was caught.
