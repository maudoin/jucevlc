/**
  Safe evaluation of class as `bool`.

  This allows a class to be safely evaluated as a bool without the usual harmful
  side effects of the straightforward operator conversion approach. To use it,
  derive your class from SafeBool and implement `asBoolean()` as:

  @code

  bool asBoolean () const;

  @endcode

  Ideas from http://www.artima.com/cppsource/safebool.html

  @class SafeBool
