/**
  A temporary audio buffer with scoped lifetime.

  This utility class allows scoped lifetime management for acquiring temporary
  audio buffers from the AudioBufferPool. It is easy to use:

  @code

  AudioBufferPoolType <CriticalSection> pool;

  // Request a stereo buffer with room for 1024 samples.
  ScopedAudioSampleBuffer buffer (pool, 2, 1024);

  // 'buffer' is released when it goes out of scope.

  @endcode

  ScopedAudioSampleBuffer is freely convertible to AudioSampleBuffer* so it
  can be used anywhere a pointer to AudioSampleBuffer is expected. The
  dereference and pointer to member operators are similarly overloaded to
  support transparent usage of the underlying AudioSampleBuffer:

  @code

  AudioBufferPoolType <CriticalSection> pool;

  ScopedAudioSampleBuffer buffer (pool, 2, 1024);

  // Call a member of AudioSampleBuffer
  buffer->clear ();

  @endcode

  Note that changing the size of a buffer is undefined.
