/**
  Notify some parent of a Component.

  This class functor will ascend the chain of parent components and call a
  member function on the first parent it finds that exposes a defined interface.
  A Component exposes the interface by deriving from the class containing the
  member function of interest. The implementation uses `dynamic_cast` to
  determine if the Component is eligible, so the interface must have a virtual
  table.

  This provides robust assistance for enforcing separation of concerns, and
  decentralizing program logic into only the areas that need it.

  In this example we will implement a ToggleButton which switches a window
  between basic and advanced modes:

  @code

  // Interface for a window that has basic and advanced modes:

  struct TwoModeWindow
  {
    virtual void onModeChanged (bool isAdvanced) = 0;
  };

  // A ToggleButton that switches between basic and advanced modes

  class AdvancedModeToggleButton : public ToggleButton
  {
  public:
    AdvancedModeToggleButton (String buttonText) : ToggleButton (buttonText)
    {
      setClickingTogglesState (true);
    }

    void clicked ()
    {
      // Inform a parent that the window mode was changed

      componentNotifyParent (this,
                              &TwoModeWindow::onModeChanged,
                              getToggleState ());
    }
  };

  @endcode

  These are some of the benefits of using this system:

  - A Component sending a notification doesn't need to know about
    the recipient.

  - A Component doesn't need to know where it is in the hierarchy
    of components in the window. You can add, remove, or reparent
    controls without breaking anything.
      
  - Child and parent components support sending and receiving notifications
    for multiple interfaces very easily.
