/**
  Lock-free FIFO memory allocator.

  This allocator is suitable for use with CallQueue and Listeners. It is
  expected that over time, deallocations will occur in roughly the same order
  as allocations.

  @note This version of the fifo free store uses less memory and doesn't require
        thread specific storage. However, it runs slower. The performance
  differences are negligible for desktop class applications.

  @invariant allocate() and deallocate() are fully concurrent.

  @invariant The ABA problem is handled automatically.
