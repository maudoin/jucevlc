/** 
  A reference counted object with overridable destroy behavior.

  This is a reference counted object compatible with
  ReferenceCountedObjectPtr. When the last reference is removed, the
  object is queued for deletion on a separate, provided thread. On
  program exit the thread will clean itself up - no other action is
  required.

  This class is useful for offloading the deletion work of "deep" objects
  shared by multiple threads: objects containing complex members, or a
  hierarchy of allocated structures. For example, a ValueTree. The problem
  of performing heavyweight memory or cleanup operations from either an
  AudioIODeviceCallback or the message thread is avoided.

  The deletion behavior can be overriden by providing a replacement
  for destroyConcurrentObject().
