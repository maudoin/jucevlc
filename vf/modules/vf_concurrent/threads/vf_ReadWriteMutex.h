/**
  Multiple consumer, single producer (MCSP) synchronization.

  This is an optimized lock for the multiple reader, single writer
  scenario. It provides only a subset of features of the more general
  traditional read/write lock. Specifically, these rules apply:

  - A caller cannot hold a read lock while acquiring a write lock.

  - Write locks are only recursive with respect to write locks.

  - Read locks are only recursive with respect to read locks.

  - A write lock cannot be downgraded.

  - Writes are preferenced over reads.

  For real-time applications, these restrictions are often not an issue.

  The implementation is wait-free in the fast path: acquiring read access
  for a lock without contention - just one interlocked increment!
