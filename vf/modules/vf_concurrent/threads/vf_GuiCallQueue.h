  A CallQueue handled by the JUCE message thread (gui).

  A singleton instance of GuiCallQueue is provided as MessageThread. Or
  you can use this one. To use this, put an instance of the class in your
  application object or other central location. Calls placed in the queue will
  automatically get processed by the Juce message loop, no further action is
  required to make it work.

  @note For most applications, using this class is not necessary, use
        MessageThread instead.
