**Documentation**
==================


Portable Application installation
------------------

Extract the archive on any folder and run **JuceVLC.exe**
All files except JuceVLC.exe are taken from VLC so you can paste JuceVLC.exe in an existing VLC installation (2.0.0 and up).
The application can be executed from a usb key or an external drive as its settings are stored along the exe file
**Under Windows 7 it is not recommanded to extract the application in "Program Files" as Windows won't allow the settings to written.**


Menu
------------------
The main menu is accessible by right clicking on the video or using the third playback control bar icon (folder in a blue dot).

The main menu can be hidden bu left clicking on the video or using the third playback control bar icon (red cross over a folder in a blue dot).

Playback control bar
------------------

The playback control bar is shown when a movie is playing. I disappear if the mouse is not moving and brought back on mouse movement.

The top slider controls the video position.
The smaller bottom slider function can be selected using the left icon:
It controls:
* audio volume
* subtitles delay
* audio delay
* playback speed
* hidden replaced by the current time and estimated movie en time

Windowed mode
------------------

This video player is meant to be use in fullscreen mode. **If you switch to windowed mode by accident, use the "Alt-Enter" key combination or hit "Fullscreen" under the "Video" menu item.**

(In windowed mode and when playing a movie the window position is only accessible by dragging the menu/playback control bar)
